# Tutorials for SE 380 (Introduction to Feedback Control)
This repository contains materials I've written up for tutorials in SE380, the introduction to analog control course for Software Engineers. The documents are built using LuaTeX. Exercises are my own construction although solutions may not be. Notes are inspired by Prof. Christopher Nielsen's notes on the course.

The motivation for this repository is for students to have write-access to the exercises in the document. This allows students to crowdsource solutions as important dates (midterm, final) approach.

 - Use the `student` branch.
